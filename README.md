# Java - B+ Tree Indexing
An implementation of the Relational Algebra operators

This is an extention of the "Java Relational Algebra" repository. A B+ Tree Map implementation has been created to allow to more quickly access the table components. I implemented the functions in the Table.java class as stated in the "Java Relational Algebra" repository, the BpTreeMap.java class, and the BpTreeMapTest.java class.

The main class in the BpTreeMap is mainly used for testing, in order to check an actual useful example of the B+ Tree Map then run the MovieDB.java class.
